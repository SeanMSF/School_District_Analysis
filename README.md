# School_District_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to assist a school board official to analyze reading and math test results for a school district comprised of 15 schools, then to observe and comment on overall changes in results when an entire class is removed from the sample due to concerns over academic dishonesty. 

# Results: 

We can see that the THS sample of Freshman was removed from the sample because our total counts of reading and math scores is reduced, values also change significantly as we will see!

Student ID       39170
student_name     39170
gender           39170
grade            39170
school_name      39170
reading_score    38709
math_score       38709

Following removal of ninth grade samples from THS, average reading and average math changed as follows:
Reading- 81.85579580976001 approx .02% change
Math- 78.93053295099331  approx .05% change
Overall passing reduced by about .27% with THS Freshmen removed

How is the school summary affected? I would say on these numbers, stark changes are not noted. The reason that THS stands out is that it's a high average math and reading school with a relatively low percentage of overall passing rate. This may be explainable that there are a few people driving up the average with implausibly high scores suggestive of cheating. 

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
